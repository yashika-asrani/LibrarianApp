<!-- 
The code defines a JavaScript module that exports a method called randomColor. When this method is called, it generates a random hexadecimal color code in the format #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB are two-digit hexadecimal values representing the red, green, and blue components of the color. This is done by generating a random number between 0 and 0xFFFFFF (which is the maximum value of a 24-bit hexadecimal number), converting it to a hexadecimal string, and concatenating it with the "#" character. -->
